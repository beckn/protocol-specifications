# How to build the specification

**Note:** All folders mentioned here are relative to the root folder ```protocol-specifications```

The full specification can be found at `api/transaction/build/transaction.yaml`

This is an autogenerated file created by compiling two sets of components namely,

1. APIs : found at `api/components/io/`
2. Schema : found at `api/components/schemas/`

The compilation flow is illustrated below



# Compilation steps

## Step 1 : Create the schema index file

- Go to the ```core/v0/api/components/schemas/``` folder
- Create a file ```index.yaml```. If already present, open it in a text editor
- It will contain a list of schema with $refs pointing to specific schema files in the ```schema/``` folder as shown below

```
Ack:
  $ref: "../../../../Ack.yaml"
  
AddOn:
  $ref: "../../../../AddOn.yaml"
...
```
- Ensure that each file in the ```schemas``` folder has an entry in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled


## Step 2 : Create the unresolved OpenAPI file

- Go to the `api/transaction/components/` folder
- In this folder, create a file - `index.yaml`. If it is already present, open it in a text editor.
- In the file, you will see the following

```
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Beckn Protocol Core
  description: Beckn Core API specification
  version: "1.1.1"

security:
  - SubscriberAuth: []
paths:
  /search:
    post:
      tags:
        - Beckn Provider Platform (BPP)
        - Beckn Gateway (BG)
      description: BAP declares the customer's intent to buy/avail products or services
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref : "./io/Search.yaml"

      responses:
        default:
          $ref: "./io/Response.yaml"

...

```
- As you can see, the ```api/transaction/components/index.yaml``` contains the unresolved Open API definitions with references to the schemas found in ```core/v0/api/components/io/```
- Ensure each API definition in the ```api/transaction/components/io/``` folder is referenced in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled. 
- Once all API referencing is done, save this file and close it.

## Install swagger CLI

- Install the swagger command line tool using ```npm``` (Note: you may need to use root privileges if installing it globally)

```
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Generate the resolved OpenAPI definition file

- Go to the root directory of this project
- Run the following command

```
swagger-cli bundle api/transaction/components/index.yaml --outfile api/transaction/build/transaction.yaml --type yaml
```

- If the command runs successfully, you should see an output like this,

```
Created api/transaction/build/transaction.yaml from api/transaction/components/index.yaml
```

- Commit the changes and push the updated code
