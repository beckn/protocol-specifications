# How to build the specification

The full specification can be found at `api/transaction/build/transaction.yaml`

This is an autogenerated file created by compiling two sets of components namely,

1. APIs : found at `api/components/io`
2. Schema : found at `core/v0/api/components/schemas`

The compilation flow is illustrated below



# Compilation steps

## Step 1 : Create the schema index file

- Go to the ```core/v0/api/components/schemas/``` folder
- Create a file ```_index.yaml```. If already present, open it in a text editor
- It will contain a list of schema with $refs pointing to specific schema files in the current folder as shown below

```
Ack:
  $ref: "./Ack.yaml"
  
AddOn:
  $ref: "./AddOn.yaml"
...
```
- Ensure that each file in the ```schemas``` folder has an entry in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled


## Step 2 : Create the unresolved OpenAPI file

- Go to the `core/v0/api/` folder
- In this folder, create a file - `core-unresolved.yaml`. If it is already present, open it in a text editor.
- In the file, you will see the following

```
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Beckn Protocol Core
  description: Beckn Core API specification
  version: "1.2.0"

security:
  - SubscriberAuth: []
  - GatewaySubscriberAuth: []
paths:
  /search:
    post:
      tags:
        - Beckn Provider Platform (BPP)
        - Beckn Gateway (BG)
      description: BAP declares the customer's intent to buy/avail products or services
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref : "./components/io/Search.yaml"

      responses:
        default:
          $ref: "./components/io/Response.yaml"

...

```
- As you can see, the ```core-unresolved.yaml``` contains the unresolved Open API definitions with references to the APIs found in ```core/v0/api/components/io/```
- Ensure each API definition in the ```core/v0/api/components/io/``` folder is referenced in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled. 
- Once all API referencing is done, save this file and close it.

## Install swagger CLI

- Install the swagger command line tool using ```npm```
- Note: you may need to use root privileges if installing it globally

```
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Generate the resolved OpenAPI definition file

- Go to the root directory of this project i.e ```protocol-specifications/```
- Run the following command

```
swagger-cli bundle core/v0/api/core-unresolved.yaml --outfile core/v0/api/build/core.yaml --type yaml
```

- If the command runs successfully, you should see an output like this,

```
Created core/v0/api/build/core.yaml from core/v0/api/core-unresolved.yaml
```

- Commit the changes and push the updated code
