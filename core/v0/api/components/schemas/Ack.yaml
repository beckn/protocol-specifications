description: Describes the acknowledgement message a BPP, BAP or BG sends as response to any beckn API calls. This can represent the acknowledged or not acknowledged status response.<br>This has one property status<br>This schema is used in the response of all the beckn API calls<br>This is used to convey the acknowledgement status of a beckn API call received by a network participant. If the network participant received the API call successfuly and has validated the request is as per protocol specifications and signature verified it can send back an ACK as status. Or else it will send NACK as status. The validation done at this point is only technical in nature (validating if the schema is as per specification, if the signature and caller is valid, if the endpoint itself is implemented) and no functional validation (as per business logic) needs to be done before sending this.
