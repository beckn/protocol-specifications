description: A collection of tag objects with group level attributes. For detailed documentation on the Tags and Tag Groups schema go to https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications/discussions/316
type: object
properties:
  display:
    description: Indicates the display properties of the tag group. If display is set to false, then the group will not be displayed. If it is set to true, it should be displayed. However, group-level display properties can be overriden by individual tag-level display property. As this schema is purely for catalog display purposes, it is not recommended to send this value during search. 
    type: boolean
    default: true
  code:
    description: The machine-readable name of the tag group. The allowed values of this property can be published at three levels namely, a) Core specification, b) industry sector-specific adaptations, and c) Network-specific adaptations. Except core, each adaptation (sector or network) should prefix a unique namespace with the allowed value. Values outside the allowed values may or may not be ignored by the rendering platform. As this schema is purely for catalog display purposes, it is not recommended to send this value during search.
    type: string
  name:
    description: A human-readable string describing the heading under which the tags are to be displayed. Sometimes, the network policy may reserve some names for this property. Values outside the reserved values can be set by the BPP. However,the BAP may choose to rename or even ignore this value and render the output purely using code property, but it is recommended for BAPs to keep the name same to avoid confusion and provide consistency. As this schema is purely for catalog display purposes, it is not recommended to send this value during `search`.
    type: string
  list:
    description: An array of Tag objects listed under this group. This property can be set by BAPs during search to narrow the `search` and achieve more relevant results. When received during `on_search`, BAPs must render this list under the heading described by the `name` property of this schema.
